# supers_assets.md — Super S EXTRA ASSETS (stages / music / etc.) for SMS

> **Doc separation rule (maintainer, 2026-07-30):** everything about integrating
> Super S assets OTHER than Sailor Saturn herself lives HERE. Saturn-the-character
> (moves, boxes, frame data, balance) lives in `saturn_notes.md`. Shared engine/ROM
> facts live in `supers_map.md`.

Status: NICE-TO-HAVE milestone, not started. This file collects locations/findings
as they fall out of other work; the dedicated analysis comes after Route A's
character port is underway.

## Inventory targets

- **Stages**: Super S stage list, per-stage assets (BG CHR/tilemaps/palettes),
  stage-select table (SMS side: patch 3's `$E8:0000` default-stage table + the
  `#$0009` random modulus are the known SMS integration points).
- **Music**: track list; SMS side: the charID→track map precedent is
  `vendor/sms-training-mode/asm/charatheme.asm` (9 entries — Saturn's theme needs a
  10th). Super S sound engine vs SMS sound engine compatibility: UNKNOWN.
- **Observed so far** (incidental): the Saturn-vs-Uranus fixture runs on a Super S
  city stage that has no SMS equivalent (see `traces/saturn/saturn_vs_uranus_supers.png`);
  Super S title/menus structurally identical to SMS (`traces/titlevram_supers_700.png`).

## ROM-space policy

Current headroom in the SMS image is ample (~1 MB under the 4 MB HiROM ceiling,
`feasibility.md`). If asset integration ever needs more: the maintainer has
pre-authorized CONSIDERING full story-mode removal (as the "tournament edition" of
SMS does) **but executing it requires EXPLICIT approval per instance** — never
remove story content on space grounds without asking first.
